# CaptionZoneData
> **Caption Zone API**

Final Data Publish Will Maintain Serial  
for example: `API-1.0.1 {api-1.0.2 -> api-1.0.3}` => `API-2.0.1 {api-2.0.2 -> api-2.0.3}` [_these **`(v.0.2++)`** are simple touched or modified api_]

```Now Latest API is listed serially in the ascending format```
> api-1.0.1 == _First API with random design_ => Paused from release

> api-2.0.1 == _Modified category item views, simplified the look_ => running in the release
